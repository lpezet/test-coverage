# Overview

This repo contains projects in different languages, specifically Python, TypeScript, and Java.

The same application (as close as possible) is coded in each language with the same test as well.
In the base case, the test will actuall **NOT** test anything, meaning it doesn't call any methods from the *testee*.

The results obviously depend on the frameworks/libraries/packages used in each project/language, but popular ones are used.

# Python

The python project is available [here](./python/myapp).

# TypeScript

The TypeScript project is available [here](./ts/myapp).

# Java

The Java project is available [here](./java/myapp).
